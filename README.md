# MovieSearchApp

## Overview
This web application works with an API to retrieve information about movies, based on users request.

## Purpose
The main rationale for this project was to showcase my understanding of the basics of Node.js, Express, and Making API calls.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- HTML (structure of the web pages).
- CSS (styling of the web pages).
- Node.js (Utilize JavaScript on the server).
- NPM (install packages: ejs, express, request).
- Express (Node.js Framework for creating server-side apps).
- The Terminal (Manipulating Files and Folders).
- Git (Version Control and interacting with Github).
- GitHub (Make Code accessbile to other developers for contribution and constructive criticism).
- Heroku (Deployment).
- PostMan (Testing API endpoints).

## How it Works
When a user visits the home page, he or she can enter the name or title of a movie into the search input field.

Once the user has filled in the name of the movie, then they can press the "**ENTER**" key on their keyboard or touchpad.

Thereafter, they will be redirected to a new page that will display detailed information about the movie they searched for.

## Notice
All the application dependenciess will be specified in the package.json file.

Please ensure to install all the required packages, as I did not upload the modules themselves.
